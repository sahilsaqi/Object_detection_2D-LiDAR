# Object Detection Using 2D LiDAR Data

This project implements object detection using 2D LiDAR data. It processes sensor data and detects obstacles or objects in the environment using advanced algorithms.

## Key Features
- Processes 2D LiDAR point cloud data.
- Detects objects within the sensor's range.
- Provides real-time or batch processing capabilities.
- Visualizes detected objects in 2D.

## Setup and Installation

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sahilsaqi/Object_detection_2D-LiDAR.git
cd Object_detection_2D-LiDAR
