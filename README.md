# Object Detection Using 2D LiDAR Data using CNN 

This project implements object detection using 2D LiDAR data. It processes sensor data and detects environmental obstacles or objects using advanced algorithms.
First, you need to have a Model and import the model files in the models folder inside the scripts and then change the file names accordingly
## Key Features
- Processes 2D LiDAR point cloud data.
- Detects objects within the sensor's range.
- Provides real-time or batch processing capabilities.
- Visualizes detected objects in 2D.

## Setup and Installation
